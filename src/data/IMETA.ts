The initiative aligns with the Indian national goal to eliminate dog-mediated rabies by 2030 through a two-pronged approach consisting of dog vaccinations and children education. As part of the partnership in 2023, Boehringer Ingelheim donated 30,000 doses of anti-rabies vaccinations and conducted a month-long awareness drive, with the support of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), to educate 1,000 school students about rabies prevention and the human-animal bond. These efforts are being replicated in 2024. "
